						<h3 class="dark-100 uppercase">Workmanship & Materials Warranty</h3>
						<p>If a tyre becomes unserviceable due to workmanship or material anomalies during the initial warranty period, which is one year from the date of original retail purchase of the replacement tyres (purchase receipt required) or within the first 1.6mm of the original usable tread, whichever occurs first, the tyre will be replaced to the owner free of charge. To receive consideration for warranty coverage, tyres must be returned to an authorised Radar Tyres dealer. Technicians designated by Radar Tyres will make the final determination regarding qualification for Workmanship and Materials coverage on tyres submitted to Radar Tyres via authorised channels. If the tyre is presented for ride related anomalies the warranty period is one year from the date of original retail purchase of the vehicle or purchase of replacement tyres (purchase receipt required) or within the first 1.6mm of the original usable tread, whichever occurs first. The owner must pay for any associated service charges, including costs associated with mounting and balancing in both the aforementioned cases.</p>
