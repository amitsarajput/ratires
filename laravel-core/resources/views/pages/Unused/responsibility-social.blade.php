		    				<h3>Giving Back to the Society</h3>
		    			</div>
		    			<p>We have always believed in giving back, both to the environment and to the society. This is one of the pillars that our company has been built on. It was these beliefs that led us to partner with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) in 2011. Together we launched “Mobilising Hope”, a corporate alliance program that supports BCRF’s mission to prevent and cure breast cancer by advancing the world's most promising research. Our support to the BCRF has not just been monetary but also heavily aimed at bringing awareness of their work into the forefront of our industry and society in general. Through this programme we continue to fund and support thousands of hours of critical life-saving research.</p>
		    			<p>Over the years we have undertaken numerous initiatives to spread awareness for this cause. Some of these include launching a limited edition pink sidewall tyre that was sold through a major distributor in the US, supporting BCRF in all major trade exhibitions and tyre fairs globally and encouraging our dealers with in-store promotion and awareness materials. We have also received tremendous support from our racing teams as they have always displayed the BCRF logo on their race vehicles and gear and recently we have had great support from our Radar Tyres’ brand ambassador and LPGA Golfer, Jodi Ewart Shadoff who has joined her efforts with us in bringing more awareness about this cause since 2016.</p>
		    			<p>In 2021, Radar Tyres is donating a minimum of $50,000 to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation® regardless of sales. BCRF’s mission is to advance the world’s most promising research to eradicate breast cancer. For more information about BCRF, visit <a href="http://www.bcrf.org">www.bcrf.org</a>.</p>
