			                  <p>Continuing on its path of social responsibility, the company commissioned EY (Ernst & Young) to do an in-depth study on the impact of the production footprint of Radar on the environment. After EY examined and quantified the amount of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) that were being produced, Omni undertook changes in its business processes and actions to offset its carbon footprint. As a result Radar Tyres was declared as the world’s first carbon neutral tyre brand by late 2013.</p>
			                  <p>In the same year the company through its flagship brand Radar Tyres also entered into the world of Motorsport with Baja racing in Mexico.</p>
