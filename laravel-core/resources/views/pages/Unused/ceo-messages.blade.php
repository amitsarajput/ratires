								<p>Dear Friends,</p>
							
								<p>Thank you for visiting the Omni United website. I wish you and your families a very happy New Year 2020! May this year bring good health, happiness, success and prosperity to everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to share some of our past achievements and our roadmap for 2020.</p> 
							
								<p>Despite the challenging context of 2019, when the automobile sector was not immune to the uncertainties of the global economy, Omni has shown exceptional resilience compared to its peers, validating its strategy of focusing on great product design, performance and safety, accessibility and leadership in terms of an inclusive and sustainable approach to mobility.</p> 
							
								<p>In 2020 we will continue to focus heavily on technology and investing in R&D. Technology will continue to be an element of distinction and excellence in the competitive tyre industry. Today, more than 60% of our revenues in the consumer segment come from premium fitments, an extraordinary growth when compared to 25% in 2016. This is the result of continuing efforts, recognised by the market, in trying to stay ahead of the needs of our consumers and partners by offering them increasingly high-tech tyres that are always aligned with the evolution of demand. These results are possible thanks to the continuous improvements of all involved at the R&D and manufacturing facilities, who are constantly increasing efficiencies in processes leading to greater value creation. Furthermore, a huge thanks to our sales team who have worked relentlessly and built a very reliable network of loyal customers in over 80 countries.</p> 
							
								<p>Our flagship brand Radar has seen exponential growth over the last 3 years and this has been the result of our continuous focus on high value fitments, with a vision to make tyres for Premium vehicles accessible to everyone. We launched the Patriot brand in 2016 and in a very short span of time it has grown and created a niche of its own. Our vision is to make Patriot into a dedicated off-road brand that resonates with the adventure craving drivers. The American Tourer brand was launched in 2017 as a focused brand for the American vehicles. Our vision is to make it into a dedicated line for the value based American drivers.</p> 
							
								<p>In 2020 we are planning to increase sports sponsorship efforts to give our brands even greater exposure. We will continue sponsoring Jodi Ewart Shadoff, a talented LPGA player and as well as continuing to excel in numerous off-road motorsport events.</p> 
							
								<p>Omni has always believed in holistic and sustainable development, which will remain a priority for us. We are proud to have completed 9 years of supporting the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) in its mission of preventing and curing breast cancer by advancing the world's most promising research. The Radar brand continues its journey as a carbon neutral tyre brand and we plan to continue refining our process in keeping our planet green and healthy as it has always been part of our DNA. We are thankful to everyone who joined us in support of our noble ventures and look forward to onboarding more stakeholders in future.</p> 
							
								<p>Omni’s Supply Chain transformation will be imperative in the achievement of our goals. It will act as a driving force through the progressive horizontal integration of our operating processes and technology in order to manage the growing complexity and uniqueness of our business model on a global scale. We will be undergoing a complete digital transformation which will result in streamlining our processes and increase our ability to foresee market demand. Moreover, with our pilot “FILL-IN” programmes in the US and Europe, we expect to reduce delivery times by more than 50%. In addition to this we will be setting up a dedicated multi-lingual Customer Service team in Singapore, capable of communicating in multiple languages to efficiently support our customers worldwide. All of these elements will enable us to serve our customers faster and more efficiently.</p> 
							
								<p>I thank you all for your business and support, and look forward to further strengthening our partnership in 2020.</p>
							
								<p>Warm regards,</p>

								<p>Dear Friends,</p>

								<p>Thanks for visiting the Omni United website.</p>

								<p>I am delighted to inform you that in the past year Omni United has continued on its path of discovery and innovation.</p>

								<p>Our Radar Tyres brand continued to grow its offering and today we have close to 1,500 SKUs to offer to our customers. Our manufacturing footprint has grown to 11 manufacturing facilities in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan. Recently we extended the range to include medium commercial truck tyres as we wanted Radar Tyres to be a one-stop-shop for our customers in our segment. The medium commercial truck tyres segment is very important for our business, between Omni United’s customers and Omnisource’s distribution warehouses we sell over 250,000 truck tyres a year and this is likely to grow significantly with the addition of Radar Tyres to the assortment/range. Today, there is no other brand in our segment that offers the range of products we offer. Our run-flat range, available in summer, all-weather and winter lines is in itself a unique offering. Run-flat tyres are no longer the privilege of the premium category; we are proud to also offer these but at affordable prices to the budget conscious consumers. To us, more than business, this is an offering for the consumers that inspires safe mobility and performance irrespective of the buying power of the consumer. Now everyone can have a run-flat tyre on their car and feel safe.</p>

								<p>Our second brand, Patriot Tyres is fast getting recognized as another great value offering. Sales continue to gain traction and the customer feedback is positive and encouraging.</p>

								<p>With the recent changes in the distribution channel in the US, we are well positioned to serve our wholesale and retail customers alike. We are already delivering fill-ins from our California and Dallas distribution centres to further strengthen our offering to our wholesale customers. We plan to work on getting more efficiency into this business model as we understand how difficult it is to forecast and stock products on a 60 days’ delivery time. While we work on the domestic fill-in, we are also working on shortening the delivery time on factory direct business by investing and using cutting edge technology. I am confident that by the end of 2018 we would have cut the delivery time by another 15 days.</p>

								<p>Innovation is in our DNA, we constantly work on improving our business model. We are investing heavily in technology across all functions and aspects of our business. We are building Omni United for the times to come where technology will play a vital role not just in product designs and production but in new delivery systems, pricing and planning among other.</p>

								<p>We are excited about the future and the tremendous possibilities it holds. We are also working with our customers to make sure we all are prepared for challenges and opportunities in our path and aligned for the times ahead.</p>

								<p>Radar Tyres remains a carbon neutral brand since 2013 and we are proud of the fact that as we move forward in life we don’t leave a mess behind for our children. Some see value in this and some don’t. Irrespective of that, we will continue our commitment to a better planet.</p>

								<p>We continue to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) and we applaud the work they do in finding a cure for this dreaded disease.</p>

								<p>I want to thank all our stakeholders, customers, manufacturing partners, the financial institutions and my most amazing colleagues who work relentlessly so that we stay ahead of the game and deliver our promise to customers every day! Thank you all!</p>

								<p>Warm regards,</p>

								<p>Dear Friends,</p>

								<p>Thanks for visiting our website!</p>

								<p>I would like to continue from where I left previously.</p>

								<p>As we continue to evolve, we found that in order to service our customers better we needed to get a worldwide on-shoring program of our own. With this customer focused service approach, we acquired two well-established companies on the western side of USA. We first acquired the 7 locations of Interstate Tyre Distributor (ITD) and then 23 more locations of A to Z Tyre company – after rationalizing the footprint, today we operate 20 of our own distribution warehouses in the states of California, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Montana, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico serving more than 15,000 retail customers.</p>

								<p>We plan to expand our distribution nationwide in the USA and overseas so we can better serve our retail customers and ultimately the end consumers better.</p>

								<p>Recently we have launched Patriot Tyres, our PLT brand nationwide with a comprehensive range in the USA.</p>

								<p>We are also launching our Radar brand medium commercial truck tyres in the US in Q2, 2017. Which will be made in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility with some very attractive tread patterns and features.</p>

								<p>The year 2017 will be a major growth year for us. We will expand our distribution footprint both, domestically in the USA and overseas, cross the 1000 SKU mark in our Radar PLT range, launch the medium commercial truck tyre range in our flagship Radar brand and launch the Patriot range internationally.</p>

								<p>We are extremely proud of our association with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, this is our fifth year and we thank BCRF for giving us this opportunity to work with them. We are committed and we will continue to support and work with the wonderful people at the BCRF.</p>

								<p>All this would not be possible without the support of our stakeholders – the financial institutions, the manufacturing facilities, the staff who worked relentlessly to get us to this point in our business and most importantly the customers. We thank all of you for being a part of our journey.</p>

								<p>We will continue to grow and evolve as a leader in thought and action in our amazing industry.</p>

								<p>Once again I thank you for your interest in Omni United, the best is yet to come!</p>

								<p>Stay tuned.</p>

								<p>Warm regards,</p>

								<p>Dear Friends,</p>

								<p>Thanks for visiting Omni United!</p>

								<p>One word defines the values and mission of Omni United: Innovation.</p>

								<p>Innovation and creativity is what drives me and what motivates my team. When we say innovation, we don’t just mean technical innovation; just as importantly, we mean new ways to look at every aspect of the industry, from manufacturing to marketing and distribution.</p>

								<p>From the days we started working in Omni United, one thing was clear to me and to the people who were with me then: We needed to do things differently – there was no space in this crowded industry for yet ‘another’ tyre supplier! So we started by finding out the “pain points” and discovered that tyres made in China were starting to find a foothold in the United States but the inefficiencies were enough to prevent customers from taking advantage of an otherwise a strong commercial proposition. We started fixing some of the issues we encountered, providing the products the market needed, allowing customers to mix products from overseas in their orders, giving credit lines to domestic US customers…and business started to grow. With time all that we did became the norm in the industry. After all, it made perfect business sense.</p>
								
								<p>We soon figured that the Chinese product lines would not be sufficient to offer our customers the comfort they needed, particularly because of the geopolitical and trade situation between countries. We started to move some of our production to other countries such as Indonesia, India and Thailand, and as a result, when in 2009, the US imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese tyre imports our business continued to grow as we were able to provide our customers with attractive alternatives.</p>
								
								<p>But innovation is continuous and we embarked on other projects such as getting our flagship brand, Radar Tyres, certified as the first 100% carbon neutral tyre brand. We started testing our off-road light truck tyres in desert races against many of the well-established and premium brands and started winning those races. We were sharing the podium with those brands and thus demonstrating our winning value proposition. To show our support to a great cause we partnered with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and even launched a tyre with a pink sidewall.</p>
								
								<p>A few years back we noticed that the tyre industry was probably one of the few industries with almost no interaction with the fashion world. We went on to develop a partnership with one of the most American fashion lifestyle brands to launch Timberland Tyres, a first in the industry. This is the first-tyre range that has been designed with sustainability in mind so that after the tyre wears out, it will be reclaimed and recycled into the soles of Timberland’s boots! In addition to traditional distribution channels, we have developed a network of over 2,000 installers ready to fit the tyres our customers buy online at timberlandtyres.com.</p>
								
								<p>We will continue to innovate and to find new ways to provide a better service for our customers.</p>
								
								<p>Stay tuned.</p>
