		    				<h3>the World’s first Carbon neutral Tyre Brand</h3>
		    			</div>
		    			<p>In 2012, we commissioned EY (Ernst & Young) to do an in-depth study on the impact of the production footprint of Radar, our flagship brand on the environment. EY examined and quantified the amount of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) produced, from procuring raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and energy used in the company’s offices and employees' travel. Based on the study recommendations, we undertook a number of changes to our business processes and actions geared to offset the carbon footprint, such as investing in projects ranging from reforestation to agroforestry. As a result, Radar Tyres became the first tyre brand to be 100% carbon neutral by late 2013 and we have maintained this to date.</p>
